We start filming a new TV show that day\nDid you go anywhere during your break?\nNot really, it was just nice to spend time with family back in my hometown. It's nice to get away from the city. Do you like the small town life?\nYes and no. My hometown was really small. Only 12 people lived there. You could blink and miss the whole town. How many people lived in your small town?\n12? wow that is small! There was 500 in mine. It's quiet and nice to get away from the hustle and bustle. How is the search for a job going? Do you have anything you really want to land for work?\nSince I'm a bit shy, don't think I want to be in a large company. Maybe I should just stay home and write a book. I bet your job is exciting!\nI can understand the shyness, it takes a lot to get over it. It can be, we're doing a game show starting Saturday. Something like \"Price Is Right\"\nSeems like you've landed a great job. Do you like it?\nYeah it's a lot of fun and you get to work with a lot of interesting people that love what they do. I've even met a few famous actors and actresses\nWow that fantastic. Having fun and getting paid for it to. I really do need to get out and find something. Especially to get away from the family during the day. Are there any job openings?",

Getting a new pet can really help with that, especially since some time has passed.\nI still have 4 cats. How do you like working from home?\nI enjoy it for the most part. It allow sme to spend time with Sally and the kitten haha\nThat's nice. Your husky would feel at home here in Alaska.\nI think so too. The weather there in Alaska is a lot better for him than here in Virginia.\nYea but Virginia is for lovers so you got that going for you.\nHaha yeah that's right! Have your headaches been getting any better?\nNot really, but I take aspirin for them. It helps, thanks for asking.\nI'm sorry to hear about that. Sometimes just petting my animals can help my stress levels",

      "text": "I mean, you said you like Stephen King. And Shawshank. I read that book. It was pretty boring. But it was also amazing. You never know what someone else might like to read. Also, doing stunts isn't always fun or exciting. Sometimes it is just falling off a roof and having to lay up for 7 weeks over a broken ankle. Nobody wants to hear about binge reading all of Jeff Wheelers books!",
      "context": "I've heard they're making a new Stephen King adaptation - I bet I end up going to see it!\nYeah, I am trying to get in on that one! I want to be in one of his movies because they are bomb!\nSo cool. Where I live they filmed the Shawshank Redemption.  I know some people who were doubles in it. I love horror but true crime is my favorite thing to read. What kind of books have you read so far this year? Any you recommend?\nOh yeah. I read this one book called The Butterfly Garden by Dot Huchinson. It was very dark and disturbing, but it was true crime/fiction. And it is still haunting me. It is a book in her collectors series. I have not yet been able to get myself to read the others in that series because it hit me pretty hard.\nWow. That sounds like something I would really love. I just finished a book myself this morning about a serial killer. Do you read your books through Kindle? Or check them out from the library?\nI have kindle unlimited and the libby app, but I believe that particular one was on Kindle Unlimited. It was about teenaged girls being kidnapped and locked in a giant jar and turned into butterflies permanently after the man and his son had their way with them. So I had to lay off her books for a bit. Oh! I also read Billy Straight. that was on libby from my library. It is AMAZING. and it is a true crime story! What was the book you read?\nI have never heard of the Libby app. I'll have to check that out. I use Kindle because I have Amazon Prime and there are a ton of free books to find that way. The book I read was called Fatal Charm. It was about a husband who murdered two of his wives staging it to look like accidents each time. I hope to find another similar one to read next. What was Billy Straight about?\nBilly Straight is about a runaway kid that goes to hollywood and pretends to be in school but lives in a park. He witnesses a high profile murder and the cops are searching for him, thinking it was like an old bag lady, but confused as to why the possible witness had a presidents book wrapped in plastic out there. I have Amazon Prime as well. The first book I mentioned may be available on Prime reading. The libby app is an app where you can use your local library card to borrow books virtually and read them on your kindle.\nOh ok. I have used other type of apps where it syncs up with the library number to check books out. I really love that option when checking out books now. Makes it so easy and convenient!\nYeah it does! I am so happy to have someone to talk about books with! Not many people that I know appreciate them as much as they should. Plus everyone always wants to know what cool stunts I have been a part of, they forget that my favorite hobby  is reading everything ever written haha.\nYou never know, with everything you have done in your past, I might read a book about YOU eventually! I can't even imagine what interesting stuff you'd be able to put in a book like that. My life is pretty monotonous so there wouldn't be much to put in a book about me.",

I'd appreciate your input regarding fashion.\nYes its not to far and i will drive us and take you home after. Yes i can defiantly help, i love to shop for new clothes so will probably get my some new stuff too.\nThat's very kind of you. What sort of budget do you suggest I have for this shopping trip?\nYour welcome. I would say around $50 you could probably get atleast two whole new outfits with that. Macy's usually have some amazing deals.\nThat's not bad! I was expecting much worse, but with my memory being so bad, I can't even remember what I spent last time I shopped for clothes!\nYeah Macy's sure is the place to shop.

I don't like to party, I do want to hang out and maybe have a few video game or movie nights\nMaybe I can come visit you in your dorm room so I feel more like I'm in college and not living with my parents. Do you think you'll try to form a study group?\nOh yes. I am all about meeting to study together. I have not had one in a year or two, but we used to do like every week a different person would get their parents to buy lunch or dinner, depending on when the meeting was. Like now, I guess that it would have to be one of us haha. But we would have like pizza and pop or burgers and fries. One girl always brought edible arrangement fruit bouquets and those were amazing! We all loved her day. They came with like caramel and yogurt fruit dip! Would you consider joining a group like that?\nOh yes, that would be great! I'd love to join a group like that. I feel like that would really make me feel like I'm part of a group and not just going to class every day and going back to my parent's hosue.\nWe can even have slumber parties to watch a movie after if the dorm allows sleeping over. Idk, I have to find out. But like a once a week slumber party with food and a movie would be amazing! And I have access to HBO Max, so we can watch a newly released movie without having to pay for it like once or twice a month!\nOh wow!  That's great! That sounds like a ton of fun. Studying turned into fun, who would've thought! I'm sure the dorm room would allow I would think.\nI hope so! Now I am more excited! We have to decide what subjects we can study together and which ones we will have to like just help out with. Like if you are taking algebra, then I can help, but I am taking a higher math. But if we are both taking BIO, we can study that together!\nThat sounds good, I'm definitely taking BIO right now. It's honestly kind of a waste of time though because it's not my major but pre-requisites suck. I wish they weren't a thing at all. Seems like a waste of money.",

The vet said it was a bacterial infection but the antibiotics should help clear things up. I'm so relieved. You know what would be the best thing about robots? They don't get sick!\nWhat would you have your robot do for you, if you got one>\nI would definitely have it be my assistant for my electrical work and have it do the more dangerous stuff. Maybe I will also have it groom my cow, since that's a fair amount of work as well. What about you?\nmine woill pay the bills, cook the meals, , clean the house, and do all the things I do not have time for.   Who is your favorite country singer?\nMy favorite country singers are Dan + Shay. You?\nI have no heard of them I like more 60s folk music, like simon and garfunkel. do you know of them?\nI have heard of that name, but I'm not familiar with their music. Have you been designing other games lately? Starcraft is a great game. I am a big fan.\nI retired from the games, I am doing robots almost exclusively. I wonder if I could maake a robot cow\nYou're welcome to visit me so that you can do some 3D modeling with my cow! But then you'd break your streak of not seeing another human being for 5 years. Don't you get lonely?",

I got a quesadilla when I went there, and it was so good!\nThat sounds delicious! I've been eating Mexican food a lot recently, I never had it when I was younger so I feel deprived of it!\nYeah, eat it up!! Mexican is the best! What is your favorite dish so far?\nTacos and quesadillas have been my go to! Everyone is really go though, I don't understand how my mom doesn't like it.\nMaybe she had a bad experience with bad food and never gave it a second chance. Maybe you should take her to lunch one day at a great place.\nYeah, that's true! I defiantly should because I think she would really enjoy it now.\nI don't see how anyone wouldn't! What types of flavors does she like, maybe I can recommend something. Does she like meats or vegetables more?\nI would say meats more! She's really into Italian dishes.\nMaybe she should get something like arroz con pollo, rice with chicken. I get that a lot. It has a delicious sauce, and some good vegetables, also. The chicken is usually so tender and delicious!",

The street car could do 60 mph. These days though electric ones are way faster due to advances in motor and battery tech. You can get electric street cars that will do 100 mph, straight out of the box.\nWait? Are you serious, over 100MPH? I can't even image a little car going that fast. Do they have different sizes?",

I haven't been much into music in a long time but sometimes I wish I listened to more.\nYes, I've always loved Dylan.  I think he's such a musical genius. He's not the only reason I want to get into music, but he's one of them.\nSince you're so interested in music, do you ever get out to see local bands? I used to go to concerts every few months when I was younger.\nYes, I try to stay connected to the local music scene, and also try to see bigger acts when they come to town, although money and time are always consideration too.  What was the last concert you went to?\nYeah, it's definitely hard to find time nowadays. I think the last concert I went to see might have been a pair of cellists with some friends. I think they were called 2Cellos but I could be mistaken.\nOh, nice.  Have you heard of Mark O'Connor?  I once saw him in concert with Yo-Yo Ma.  That was amazing.\nYeah, I think I ran across some of his performances on YouTube at some point. I could listen to violin and cello music all the time if I had the opportunity. I like to put on videos in the background to provide some background noise. And an occasional distraction.\nYes, I love listening to classic or baroque if I'm doing something that needs concentration.  Do you listen to music when you ride your bike?\nI should. Usually I'm listening to podcasts when I'm riding my bike. Since I don't have much time I try to keep abreast of current events that way.",

I am trying to less so i dont know why I would tempt myself like that\nYeah I don’t drink much anymore but I do like a bourbon every once and a while. Oh I meant to tell you I found an old cello at a flea market and am trying to fix it up. I knew you were interested in those. Want to come over and see it?\nI would really like that! Did they have a lot of cellos there? I might have to go see what they have myself someday\nNo but I saw some before. I like looking for older string instruments when I go out. I can let you know next time I see one.\nThat would be so nice, what do you do with the older string instruments you find? Do you just fix them up and keep them or do you sell them?\nI have brought some to the local college for students. I gave a few to some inspiring musicians like me. I sold one on eBay before but I don’t like eBay too much after the issues I had last time.\nWow, you are a really nice person! What happened with eBay? Some people just want to steal money and they don't care about the person on the other end\nI had someone claim the product was damaged but didn’t want to send it back or show proof, just wanted their money back. I think they were trying to scam me. I don’t make enough as a custodian to lose out on stuff like that.\nThat is really unfair and I'm sorry that you had to go through that. Is there anyway that I can support your dream of being a professional musician?",

I don't really enjoy reading either, but I was kind of intrigued by the chemistry book haha!\ntotally! it's helpful to have a guide for that kind of hobby.  wish I had the space for it! do you have to live on base for the army?\nNo, I'm in an apartment just off the base, so I had a bit of space for my hobbies.  Do you have a plan to get to your goal of owning a bookstore?  I imagine it's a complicated process to own your own business!\nthat's my hope -- trying to find space to rent is so hard though! I can't decide on what a good location is. think I should aim for a downtown area or a suburb?\nThere are certainly benefits with either choice of location.  Is the bookstore you currently work in located right in the city?  I bet that's a very expensive location.\nyes it is. the foot traffic is good for business though.

I am able to get outdoors after work but it would be nice to spend daytime hours outside. Do you spend much time outdoors?\nHave you asked if they can make your schedule more flexible?",

I'm expecting pineapple and ham on everything, but I know they will having some amazing cultural food that is probably going to blow my mind! Is there a specific dish you would recommend\nI enjoy foods like Spam musubi, loco mocos, and poi. My favorite might be kalua pork. The way they prepare the pig makes it taste so good.\nThat all sounds really good, I will check it out. I saved up a lot of money to splurge on everything. I'm excited to walk the beach, even though I hate the beach.",

I was driving to the grocery store the other day, when I noticed a bin labeled \"Donation for Shoes and Clothing.\"  It was easier than I thought!  How about you?  Why do you have so many pairs of sandals?\nI don't understand myself! When I look them online I just have the urge to buy them, even when I know I don't need them. This addiction is getting worse and worse.\nI completely agree that buying shoes can become an addiction!  Are there any ways you can make money from home while waiting for a job offer from a call center?\nWell I already got the job so I just need to learn using the software. When I was still searching for jobs, we actually do a yard sale to sell many of my random items that are never used and clearly aren't needed either.\nCongratulations on getting the job!  I know it'll help you out so much.  And of course, maybe I should turn to yard sales as well, for they can be a great way to make some extra cash!\nDo you have another job or do you compose music for a living? How does your shopping addiction go?\nAs a matter of fact, I do have another job in addition to composing music.  I'm actually a music teacher at a private school, and on the side, I compose music for friends and family.  As far as my shopping addiction goes, it's getting better.  I promised myself that I wouldn't buy myself any more shoes this year!\nAh, I remember the time I promised myself the same thing on not buying random things anymore, never work so far. Good luck with yours!\nThanks!  I need the good luck wishes.  I've been avoiding malls and shopping outlets.  Maybe you can try the same!\nI can avoid them physically, but with my job enable me sitting in front of my computer for a long period of time, I already turn the shopping addiction into online-shopping addiction. lol. Wish me luck!",

Sonny and I like to watch tv too.  So, what kind of hunting are you planning to do when it gets warmer?\nProbably deer, that's the animal my dad taught me to hunt the most.

This is why I am so sad that the weather here is not suitable for hunting conditions. Does farming take all your time?\nIt really does.  I mean, you get up before sunrise to work and you work all day past sunset.  You can't take a day off because the crops always need tending to.  That's cool that your whole family likes it!  By the way, have you ever had a deer mounted or stuffed?",

What's a resume?\nIt's a listing of all of your past work experience and educational background. It gives potential employers a quick look at who you are professionally. This is one of those times when it's good to be a nerd!\nOh okay. I can't wait to start working and build a resume for myself! I'm pretty good at writing. Maybe it won't be so hard. You may have to show me an example of one though when the time comes for me to be able to work. Man it's nice outside. Hows the weather where you're at?\nI can totally help you with your resume. Just ask when you're ready! It's kind of cool outside right now; cooler than I'd expect for this time of year. But at least it's comfortable -- I've been taking my easel outside to paint lately.\nThat's cool. What do you like to paint? I've tried to paint in art class, but my painting of Slayer looks more like messy lava haha.\nHa! I'm sure it's better than you think it is! I like landscapes mostly. There's something soothing about a pastoral scene.",

Do you like your new laptop?\nOh yeah I do, I will really like to meet your kids someday.\nMaybe someday! It has been really nice talking to you.\nYes and for me too. What device do your kids play with??",

Great for you! Walking every afternoon will definitely get you started on the right path to losing weight, then maybe I can convince to fully go through with the Keto diet! I could start you off with an easy recipe, interested?\nThanks I'm pretty proud of myself. An easy recipe would be wonderful. I am not very knowledgeable regarding the keto diet and need help getting started.Have you managed to get your daily 5 mile runs in?\nThat's wonderful, you should be very proud! And yes here's a simple easy recipe you could start out with, Crock pot/Instant Pot bbq baby back ribs! It includes the things you like and your kids will probably love it too! I have been getting my 5 mile runs in every day now! It's so much easier the more often you do it. Would you be interested in running with me one day?\nYes, I would like to be able to run with you one day. I am going to have to work my way up to it. How long did it take you to get to the point where you could run 5 miles at one time. I am struggling to just walk 3 miles.My kids however, have no problem doing it.\nYes we'll definitely work you up to it! It took me about 3 months of training and practice to be able to run 5 miles a day. It definitely was not easy, but I love it! And of course the kiddos have no problem walking 3 miles, they're so full of energy. Speaking of which, do you have any pets you bring on these walks?\nGreat we will work up to it. Did you start off walking first too? We do have a puppy, but it is not properly leash trained yet. What about you, do you have a pet that runs with you? Oh, and thanks for the recipe.\nI did start off walking first. Otherwise I would have just given up completely trying to run. Then I would run a mile each day for a couple of weeks and work my way up. I do have a dog, a german shepherd who runs with me all the time and loves it! His name's Bosco! What kind of pup do you guys have? And you're welcome for the recipe!",

I don't think you can go wrong with any espresso machine as long as you're willing to pay the price. I love going to coffee shops but having my own machine means I'll save a lot of money. The same goes for cooking but this Friday will be special because I love Mexican food!\nSince you have reservation on Loaded Bowl this Friday let's just meet there. We can meet on our place next time so Eddy and I will have more time to prepare.\nThat sounds good. Feel free to dress comfortably. This is just a night to hang out and eat some good food. I enjoy my leisure time and I want to enjoy this as much as I can.\nAgree! I mostly dress comfortably when I go out, especially for enjoying good food. Maybe because I grew up in a farm I always feel uneasy even seeing people dress too formal and stiff, can't imagine wearing it myself.\nI feel the same way. I don't usually go out much and kind of find it overwhelming, so it'll be nice to get out with some friends. Maybe you can have a drink or two if you're up for it.",

It is so easy to forget when you have a car and can get what you like, but not everyone is so lucky. Do you know the best way to get others involved? City counsel meeting or go straight to the community?\nI think going straight to the community is probably better.  Real grass roots stuff.  If you associate it with city counsel you run the risk of people being turned off of it, or city counsel being encouraged to interfere too much.\nAhh. Yes, I hear ya. Probably better to make sure there is support from the community and make sure they are getting something that is actually useful for them.",

      "context": "Have you ever thought about trying to start your own co-op with some of your neighbors?\nIt has actually crossed my mind a lot since we last spoke! There is one about an hour away. I was thinking of going to talk to them and see how their business model is working and helping the community.\nI think that's a good idea.  Getting information straight from people who have the experience is usually invaluable, and I'm sure they'd love to tell you about their co-op.\nAnd I would of course do a little shopping as a thank you. I have started to realize that there are many areas in my city that are food deserts. A co-op could really change lives here.\nYes, that seems like a fair barter: a little information for some business.  In your city is it anything in particular that's difficult to get?\nIf you don't have a car it is basically impossible to get fresh produce if you live downtown.

I was kind of a science geek.  Believe it or not I like working with middle school.  They are difficult but still a lot of fun.\nI understand. Is being a teacher still on the table for you or will you pursue a different career?\nIt's not really on the table anymore.  I like research more than teaching...I like the idea of asking questions other people haven't asked or explored yet.  I'm headed into the social science right now.  Studying people and the way we interact with one another and the environment around us.\nThat is an inspiring and terrific field to enter. And who knows, if teaching doesn't work out, maybe I will find myself in the research field. Hopefully you would be able to give me some pointers.",

Once I get rid of this debt though, it will all be better.\nYeah, I guess once that debt is gone you can have a little extra cash to do some fun stuff.  I'm trying to work my way through school so I can have as little student loan debt as possible.\nThat is a very smart plan. What kind of job do you have right now? I am a grocery store clerk, but I am only doing it until I can find a more permanent job in education.\nI'm actually driving uber and doing some other gig work.
